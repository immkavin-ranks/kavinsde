### **Example: Blockchain for Milk Supply Chain in India**

#### Problem:
In India, the milk supply chain involves multiple stakeholders like farmers, collection centers, processing units, distributors, and retailers. Challenges include:
- Lack of transparency in milk quality and pricing.
- Delays in payments to farmers.
- Difficulty in tracing the source of milk in case of quality issues (e.g., contamination).

#### Solution:
A blockchain-based system is implemented to track milk from the farm to the consumer. Here's how it works:

1. **Farmers Register Milk Production**:
   - Farmers record details like milk quantity, quality (fat content, purity), and timestamps on the blockchain when they supply milk to collection centers.

2. **Collection Centers**:
   - Collection centers verify the milk quality and update the blockchain with additional details (e.g., temperature, storage conditions).

3. **Processing Units**:
   - Processing units (e.g., dairy companies) record processing details like pasteurization, packaging, and batch numbers on the blockchain.

4. **Distributors and Retailers**:
   - Distributors and retailers update the blockchain with shipment and delivery details, ensuring the milk reaches stores on time.

5. **Consumers**:
   - Consumers can scan a QR code on the milk packet to see the entire journey of the milk, from the farm to the store, ensuring transparency and trust.

#### Benefits:
- **Transparency**: All stakeholders can access real-time data, ensuring trust and accountability.
- **Fair Payments**: Farmers receive timely and fair payments through smart contracts.
- **Quality Assurance**: Contaminated milk can be traced back to its source quickly, ensuring food safety.
- **Efficiency**: Reduces paperwork and manual errors, streamlining the supply chain.
