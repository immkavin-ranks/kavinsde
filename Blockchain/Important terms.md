- **Blockchain:** A blockchain is an accurate and permanent record of transactions that have been verified and stored in a chronological sequence.
- **Blocks:** A block is an individual transaction or piece of data that is being stored within the blockchain.
- **Blockchain Network:** The blockchain network and blockchain are terms used interchangeably. They represent the entire blockchain from the structure itself to the network that it is a part of.
- **Decentralization:** The concept in which users work together to validate transactions without relying on a central authority.
- **Participant**: A client that owns a copy of the blockchain and verifies transactions across the network.
- **Deterministic:** The same input will always produce the same output, but that output will never produce the original input.
- **Hash:** A fixed-length string of a varying combination of letters and numbers produced from a specific input of arbitrary size.
- **Hash Function:** A function that takes in an input of a random size, performs hashing on this input, and generates a random output of a fixed size, also known as the hash.
- **Genesis Block:** The genesis block is the first block on the blockchain and it is typically hard-coded into the blockchain structure. Being the first block on the blockchain, it does not have a link to a previous hash.
- **Transaction:** An exchange of value among participants on the blockchain network.
- **Participants:** Individuals accessing the blockchain network through computers to exchange value.
- **Unconfirmed:** Blocks and transactions that are yet to be verified.
- **Consensus:** The process of agreeing to the transactions on the blockchain network.
- **Hashing:** Generating a random string of characters from a given input.
- **Immutable:** Something whose records can’t be changed.
- **Recalculating Hashes:** Replacing the incorrect hash with a “correct” one to validate the chain.
- **Proof-of-Work:** A security feature in blockchain to prevent attackers from easily taking over the blockchain.
- **Trustless:** A feature of blockchain that states how the system doesn’t rely on any participant to verify transactions.
- **Longest Chain:** The most trusted chain with the largest amount of computational work done in calculating the Proof-of-Work.

**Block Properties**
- **Timestamp:** The time the block is created determines the location of it on the blockchain.
- **Data:** The information to be securely stored in the block.
- **Hash:** A unique code produced by combining all the contents within the block itself — also known as a digital fingerprint.
- **Previous Hash:** Each block has a reference to the block prior to its hash. This is what makes the blockchain unique because this link will be broken if a block is tampered with.
- **Nonce**: A number to be added with Transaction data to produce required hash.
