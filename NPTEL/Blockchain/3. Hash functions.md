Cryptographically secure hash functions

arbitrarily size input => fixed sized output

Deterministic
Hash functions are one way functions

Collision
Information hiding

x => message 
H(x) => Message digest 
Difficult to find X from H(X) => Computationally difficult
Avalanche Effect

if H(x) and H(y) is same, then x = y

Y = H(X || k) k => mined value => Computationally difficult
X, Y => priori
