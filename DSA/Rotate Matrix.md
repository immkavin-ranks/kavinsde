Rotate Matrix

Given an image represented by an `NxN` matrix write a method to rotate the image by 90 degrees.

You have to rotate the image **in-place**, which means you have to modify the input 2D matrix directly.

**DO NOT** allocate another 2D matrix and do the rotation.

```java
for (int i = 0; i < arr.length; i++) {
	
}
```

	a00 a01 a02
	a10 a11 a12
	a20 a21 a22

	a20 a10 a00
	a21 a11 a01
	a22 a12 a02
