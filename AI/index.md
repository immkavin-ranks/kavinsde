# Introduction

> There are three kinds of intelligence: one kind understands things for itself, the other appreciates What others can understand, the third understands neither for itself nor through others. The first kind is excellent, the second good, and the third useless.
> - NiccolÃ² Machiavelli

- **Artificial intelligence** (AI) is the study of how to make computers do things which, at the moment, people do better.
- AI is Artificial Intelligence till it is achieved; after which the acronym reduces to Already Implemented.

# The AI Problems

>Although expert skills require knowledge that many of us do not have, they often require much less knowledge than do the more mundane skills and that knowledge is usually easier to represent and deal with inside programs.

## Some of the Task Domains of Artificial Intelligence

**Mundane Tasks**
1. Perception
	- Vision
	- Speech
2. Natural language
	- Understanding
	- Generation
	- Translation
3. Commonsense reasoning
4. Robot control

**Formal Tasks**
1. Games
	- Chess
	- Backgammon
	- Checkers -Go
2. Mathematics
	- Geometry
	- Logic
	- Integral calculus
	- Proving properties of programs

**Expert Tasks**
1. Engineering
	- Design
	- Fault finding
	- Manufacturing planning
2. Scientific analysis
3. Medical diagnosis
4. Financial analysis

# The underlying assumption about Intelligence

**Physical symbol system hypothesis**

>It also forms the basis of the belief that it is possible to build programs that can perform intelligent tasks now performed by people.

# AI Technique

- Intelligence requires knowledge
- To compensate for its one overpowering asset, indispensability, knowledge possesses some less desirable properties. including:
	1. It is voluminous.
	2. It is hard to characterize accurately.
	3. It is constantly changing.
	4. It differs from data by being organized in a way that corresponds to the ways it will be used.
