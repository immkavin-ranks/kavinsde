### Notes

- Cloud computing is a model for enabling ubiquitous, convenient, on-demand network access to a shared pool of configurable computing resources (e.g., networks, servers, storage, applications, and services) that can be rapidly provisioned and released with minimal management effort or service provider interaction.
- This cloud model is composed of five essential characteristics, three service models, and four deployment models.
- Essential Characteristics
    - On-demand self service
    - Broad network access
    - Resource pooling
    - Rapid elasticity
    - Measured service
- Service Models
    - Software as a Service
    - Platform as a Service
    - Infrastructure as a Service
- Deployment Models
    - Private cloud
    - Community cloud
    - Public cloud
    - Hybrid cloud

ðŸ“Œ **SUMMARY:** Cloud computing provides on-demand network access to shared computing resources, featuring on-demand self-service, broad network access, resource pooling, rapid elasticity, and measured service. It includes service models like SaaS, PaaS, and IaaS, and deployment models such as private, community, public, and hybrid clouds.
