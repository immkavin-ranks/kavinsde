Android is a software package and Linux based operating system **for mobile devices** such as tablet computers and smartphones. It is developed by **Google** and later the **OHA (Open Handset Alliance).** 

**Java** language is mainly used to write the android code even though other languages can be used. The goal of android project is to create a successful real-world product that improves the mobile experience for end users. 

Android has expanded beyond a pure mobile phone platform to provide a development platform for an increasingly **wide range of hardware**, including tablets and televisions. 

Android is an ecosystem made up of a combination of three components:

- A free, open-source operating system for embedded devices
- An open-source development platform for creating applications
- Devices, particularly mobile phones, that run the Android operating system and the applications created for it

Android is made up of several necessary and dependent parts, including the following:

- A Compatibility Definition Document (CDD) and Compatibility Test Suite (CTS) that describe the capabilities required for a device to support the software stack.
- **A Linux operating system kernel** that provides a low-level interface with the hardware, memory management, and process control, all optimized for mobile and embedded devices.
- **Open-source libraries** for application development, including SQLite, Web Kit, OpenGL, and a media manager.
- A **run time** used to execute and host Android applications, including the **Dalvik Virtual Machine (VM) and the core libraries** that provide Android-specific functionality. The run time is designed to be small and efficient for use on mobile devices.
- An **application framework** that agnostically exposes system services to the application layer, including the window manager and location manager, databases, telephony, and sensors.
- A **user interface framework** used to host and launch applications.
- A set of core pre-installed applications.
- A **software development kit (SDK)** used to create applications, including the related tools, plug-ins, and documentation.

1. **Native Android Applications:**

Android devices typically come with a suite of **preinstalled applications** that form part of the **Android Open Source Project (AOSP),** including, but not necessarily limited to, the following:

 - An e-mail client
 - An SMS management application
 - A full PIM (personal information management) suite, including a calendar and contacts list
 - A Web Kit-based web browser
 - A music player and picture gallery
 - A camera and video recording application
 - A calculator
 - A home screen
 - An alarm clock
 
In many cases Android devices also ship with the following **proprietary Google mobile applications:**

- The Google Play Store for downloading third-party Android applications
- A fully featured mobile Google Maps application, including StreetView, driving directions, and turn-by-turn navigation, satellite views, and traffic conditions
- The Gmail email client
- The Google Talk instant-messaging client
- The YouTube video player
 
The data stored and used by many of these native applications such as contact details are also available to third-party applications. Similarly, your applications can respond to events such as incoming calls. 

The exact makeup of the applications available on new Android phones is likely to vary based on the hardware manufacturer and/or the phone carrier or distributor.

The open-source nature of Android means that carriers and **OEMs can customize the user interface and the applications bundled with** each Android device. Itâ€™s important to note that for compatible devices, the underlying platform and SDK remain consistent across OEM and carrier variations. 

The **look and feel of the user interface may vary,** but your applications will function in the same way across all compatible Android devices.

2. **Android SDK features:**

As an application neutral platform, Android gives you the opportunity to create applications that are as much a part of the phone as anything provided **out-of-the-box.** 

The following list highlights some of the most noteworthy Android features:

- GSM, EDGE, 3G, 4G, and LTE networks for telephony or data transfer, enabling you to make or receive calls or SMS messages, or to send and retrieve data across mobile networks
- Comprehensive APIs for location-based services such as GPS and network-based location detection
- Full support for applications that integrate map controls as part of their user interfaces
- Wi-Fi hardware access and peer-to-peer connections
- Full multimedia hardware control, including playback and recording with the camera and microphone
- Media libraries for playing and recording a variety of audio/video or still-image formats and
- APIs for using sensor hardware, including accelerometers, compasses, and barometers
- Libraries for using Bluetooth and NFC hardware for peer-to-peer data transfer and IPC message passing
- Shared data stores and APIs for contacts, social networking, calendar, and multimedia
- Background Services, applications, and processes
- Home-screen Widgets and Live Wallpaper
- The ability to integrate application search results into the system searches
- An integrated open-source HTML5 Web Kit-based browser
- Mobile-optimized, hardware-accelerated graphics, including a path-based 2D graphics library and support for 3D graphics using OpenGL ES 2.0
- Localization through a dynamic resource framework
- An application framework that encourages the reuse of application components and the replacement of native applications
