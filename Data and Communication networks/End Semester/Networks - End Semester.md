### UNIT III
1. Purpose of error detection in [data link protocol](https://technicam.blogspot.com/2015/07/summary-of-data-link-protocol.html)
   - Error detection in data link protocols ensures the integrity of data transmitted between nodes. 
   - It involves detecting and, in some cases, correcting errors that may occur during transmission due to noise or other disturbances.
2. Types of [synchronous protocols](https://technicam.blogspot.com/2015/04/synchronous-protocols.html)
   - Bit oriented protocols - HDLC
   - Character oriented protocols - BSC
3. [Asynchronous protocols](https://technicam.blogspot.com/2015/04/asynchronous-protocols.html)
4. Differentiate synchronous and asynchronous protocols
5. BSC frames of character oriented protocol
