### Answers: 

1. **Vision and Goals of .NET:**
- Vision: To create a platform-independent development environment
- Goals: 
  - Provide language interoperability
  - Ensure platform independence
  - Simplify application deployment and versioning
  - Deliver high performance and security

2. **Two Building Blocks of .NET Framework:**
- Common Language Runtime (CLR)
- .NET Framework Class Library (FCL)

3. **Design Goals of .NET Framework:**
- Language independence
- Platform independence
- Secure execution environment
- Simplified deployment model

4. **Role of CLR in .NET:**
- Manages code execution
- Handles memory management
- Provides security and type safety
- Performs garbage collection
- Enables language interoperability

5. **Purpose of FCL:**
- Provides pre-built libraries and reusable components
- Contains comprehensive set of APIs
- Enables rapid application development
- Ensures consistency across .NET applications

6. **Variables in VB.NET:**
- Named memory locations that store data
- Declared using 'Dim' keyword and can change during program execution
- Example: `Dim age As Integer = 25`

7. **Constants in VB.NET:**
- Declared using 'Const' keyword
- Value cannot be changed during program execution
- Example: `Const PI As Double = 3.14159`

8. **Control Statements in VB.NET:**
- Statements that control program flow
- Main types:
  - Decision statements (If-Then, Select Case)
  - Loop statements (For, While, Do-While)

9. **Purpose of Methods in VB.NET:**
- Reusable blocks of code that perform specific tasks
- Help in organizing code and promoting reusability
- Can accept parameters and return values

10. **Arrays in VB.NET:**
- Collection of elements of same data type
- Stored in contiguous memory locations
- Declared using 'Dim' keyword
- Example: `Dim numbers(4) As Integer`
