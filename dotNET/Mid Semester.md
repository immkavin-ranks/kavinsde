   - Allow seamless integration between different languages
   - Common Type System (CTS) for cross-language compatibility

1. **Platform Independence:**
- **Cross-Platform Development**
   - Write once, run anywhere philosophy
   - Support for Windows, Linux, and macOS
   - Cloud-ready applications through .NET Core

2. **Performance and Security:**

   - Simplified application installation
   - Version control management
   - Side-by-side execution support

>12. **Variables and Constants in VB.NET with Examples**

1. **Variables:**
    - Variables are named memory locations that store data which can be modified during program execution
    - Declared using the `Dim` keyword
    - Examples:
        ```vb
        Dim age As Integer = 25
        Dim name As String = "John"
        Dim salary As Double = 50000.50
        ```
2. **Constants:**
    - Constants are fixed values that cannot be changed during program execution
    - Declared using the `Const` keyword
    - Must be initialized when declared
    - Examples:
        ```vb
        Const PI As Double = 3.14159
        Const TAX_RATE As Decimal = 0.18
        Const COMPANY_NAME As String = "TechCorp"
        ```
3. **Key Differences:**
    - Variables can be modified during runtime; constants cannot
    - Constants must be assigned values at declaration time
    - Constants typically use uppercase naming convention
    - Variables consume memory at runtime; constants are replaced with their values during compilation
4. **Scope and Lifetime:**
    - Both variables and constants can have different scopes:
        - Local (within a procedure)
        - Module-level (within a module)
        - Class-level (within a class)
5. **Best Practices:**
    - Use meaningful names for both variables and constants
    - Use constants for values that won't change
    - Initialize variables before using them
    - Declare variables with appropriate data types

>**Building Blocks of the .NET Framework**
