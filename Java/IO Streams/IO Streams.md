# Streams

>Java programs perform I/O through streams. An stream is an abstraction or a logical entity that either produces or consumes information. An I/O stream is linked to a physical device by the Java I/O system.

There are many classes and interfaces in the `java.io` package. These include byte and character streams, and object serialization (the storage and retrieval of objects).
