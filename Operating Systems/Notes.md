# How Computers Work

- Input is data we give to our computers
- Processing is comprised of the translation of input and the instructions given for output
- Memory is used to store either temporary or permanent information
- Output is the information that gets returned by the computer

# Introduction to Operating Systems

>An **Operating System,** or OS, is system software that’s responsible for handling the basic functionalities. At the core of an operating system is the **_kernel_** which manages all the interactions between the hardware and software components of a computer.

## Functions of an OS

Some of the vital functions of an OS:

- Process Management 
- Memory Management
- File System Management
- IO Management
- Multitasking
- Networking
- Security
- Providing a user interface

**Process**: When we run a program, the instance of that execution is represented by a process.

**CPU**: The CPU controls all the different components between hardware and software by processing all of the information that flows throughout the computer.

CPUs generally consist of three main components: a control unit (CU), an arithmetic and logic unit (ALU), and a collection of registers.

The control unit (**CU**) is the overseer of the CPU, responsible for controlling and monitoring the input and output of data from the computer’s hardware. Its primary job is making sure that data is sent to the right component at the right time, and arrives with integrity.

The arithmetic and logic unit (**ALU**) is where all of the processing of the computer takes place. It is the fundamental part of the CPU that actually does the arithmetic calculations of the data as well as the handling of logical comparisons and conditionals.

The **register**, or immediate access store, is a limited space, high-speed memory mounted on the CPU for quick processing. It provides the CPU with a place to store values that are crucial for the calculations the ALU is currently processing.

**Kernel**: The kernel manages all of the interactions between the hardware and software components of a computer, such as interfacing with memory and hard drives.
